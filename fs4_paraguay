DESCRIPTION
When a family tragedy hits you, there’s a number of paths your life can take. 
However, not many people would choose the rebellious path that today’s guest took: leaving their home country, 
setting up in rural Paraguay and founding a charity to support education.

Margaret Hebblethwaite joins us to talk about what education is really about, 
Paraguayan doublethink, and why a rebellious nature is something to treasure.
